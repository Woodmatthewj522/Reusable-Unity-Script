# Reusable Monobehavior Scripts for Unity ONLY
*Use both for a working third person controller*
# CharacterFollow Not in use, FollowCamera/CharacterController are
#
# How-To-Use
1. Create a folder, name it scripts (If you don't have one already)
2. Right click new "Scripts" folder, Create new monobehavior Script (for both! x2)
3. Copy/Paste CameraFollow, attach that script to camera
4. Copy/Paste CharacterController script to a separate monobehavior script.
5. Attach CharacterController Script to "Player", or GameObject you'd like to use
# Allows for very easy additions/adjustments
# Very SIMPLE scripts, future updates could include 
- click/hold/drag for camera/character movement
